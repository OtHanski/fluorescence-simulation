"""
Main file for running the simulation, only implement the main simulation loop here. 
Should be run from CMD.

Set up the simulation environment (Samplecell profile, how many sims), and run the 
simulation loop (Create new photon objects, simulate them). Append results to file 
every N simulations to avoid memory overflow and to avoid losing data in case of crash.

Finally, plot data and results with pyplot.

If you're *really* bored, multithread the operation :D
