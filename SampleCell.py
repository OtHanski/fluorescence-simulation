"""
File for defining the sample cell geometry. The cell has a 
z-coordinate and a radius as a function of z. We always assume
cylindrical symmetry. The profile should
be defined as a np-array of length n of r values corresponding to z values. 
Constructor of the form SampleCell(samples, z, r), with z and r numpy arrays 
of length samples.

Then calculate the angle of the wall against z-axis as a function of z, defined 
as the difference between successive r values (angle = atan(dr/dz). Save these 
angles in a numpy array of length n-1 for quick lookup during photon reflection events.

For the same buckets, define a wavelength-dependent absorption probability on the wall
as well as probabilities of specular and diffuse reflection.

To account for non-cylindrical (but still cylindrically symmetric) cells, we must check 
the wall hits in 3D, as hits to an angled wall will change the direction of the photon 
for both angles.
